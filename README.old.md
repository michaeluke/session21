## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this jobs board using a [SERP Google Jobs Listing API](https://serpapi.com/google-jobs-listing-api) to retrieve the data. Your goal is to try to get your project looking as close to the [design](https://www.figma.com/file/ivPJIvkzB4gOR0T4xazrq2/devjobs-web-app?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=TAj8Ycox9bWfZm3N-1) as possible.
